# AWS Serverless Events Platform

[![Terraform Validation](https://github.com/Mazdaratti/tf-template-stack/actions/workflows/terraform-validation.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/Mazdaratti/tf-template-stack/actions/workflows/terraform-validation.yml)
[![License: MIT](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MIT-yellow.svg)](./LICENSE)

A production-style, fully AWS-native serverless web application for managing events and RSVP workflows.

The system demonstrates modern cloud architecture patterns including transactional serverless writes, event-driven extensions, managed authentication, edge security, and Infrastructure as Code using Terraform.

This project is designed as a **cloud engineering portfolio showcase** and follows real-world engineering practices such as least-privilege IAM, cost-aware design, incremental delivery, and modular infrastructure composition.

## Project Goals

- Build a production-shaped serverless platform using managed AWS services
- Demonstrate **transactional API workflows with asynchronous extensions**
- Apply security best practices (edge protection, managed identity, least privilege)
- Implement observability and operational readiness patterns
- Use Terraform as the single source of infrastructure truth
- Follow clean Git workflow and small, reviewable infrastructure changes
- Stay within AWS Free Tier and promotional credits

## Target Architecture

The platform uses native AWS serverless services:

- Amazon CloudFront
- AWS WAF
- Amazon S3
- Amazon API Gateway
- AWS Lambda
- Amazon DynamoDB
- Amazon Cognito
- Amazon SQS
- Amazon EventBridge
- Amazon SNS
- Amazon CloudWatch
- AWS X-Ray

AWS Shield Standard provides automatic edge protection.

---

## Target System Workflow

### Frontend Delivery

1. Users access the application through **Amazon CloudFront**.
2. CloudFront securely serves static frontend assets from a private **Amazon S3** bucket.
3. **AWS WAF** filters malicious traffic at the edge before requests reach the backend.

### API Request Flow

4. The frontend sends API requests to **Amazon API Gateway**.
5. Route protection is enforced at API Gateway using a hybrid authorizer model:
   - native JWT authorizer for ordinary protected routes
   - a dedicated Lambda authorizer for the mixed-mode RSVP route

### Event Management

6. API Gateway invokes a **Lambda function** to create or retrieve event data.
7. Event information is stored in **Amazon DynamoDB**, providing scalable serverless persistence.

### RSVP Processing

8. RSVP submissions are handled as a **synchronous business operation**.
9. The primary RSVP write path is:

`Client -> API Gateway -> Lambda -> DynamoDB transaction`

10. This design preserves the current API contract so the caller immediately knows whether:
- the RSVP was created
- the RSVP was updated
- the event is already at capacity
- access is forbidden
- the event does not exist

### Event-Driven Extensions

11. After a successful durable write, domain events such as event creation or RSVP confirmation are published to **Amazon EventBridge**.
12. EventBridge routes these events to **Amazon SNS**, enabling notifications and future integrations.
13. **Amazon SQS** remains part of the platform for asynchronous side effects and decoupled follow-up processing such as:
- notification buffering
- enrichment tasks
- reconciliation or repair jobs
- batch imports
- scheduled backfills
- retryable downstream integrations

### Observability

14. Logs and metrics are collected in **Amazon CloudWatch**.
15. Distributed tracing is enabled with **AWS X-Ray** to analyze request performance and dependencies.

This design preserves immediate correctness for core business writes while still enabling scalable asynchronous processing where it adds real value.

---

## Key Architecture Decisions

**Fully Serverless Design**

Avoids infrastructure management and enables automatic scaling.

**Synchronous Core, Async Extensions**

Core RSVP business writes are intentionally kept synchronous so the system can preserve immediate business-result semantics required by the current API contract.

Asynchronous processing is reserved for durable post-commit work, starting with notification dispatch through SQS and expanding later only when additional background workloads are concretely justified.

**Managed Authentication**

Amazon Cognito replaces custom authentication logic, improving security and reducing operational overhead.

The routed API uses a hybrid authorizer model so ordinary protected routes stay
simple while the RSVP route can support anonymous and authenticated callers on
one business operation.

**No VPC Architecture**

Simplifies networking and keeps costs low while still supporting production-grade patterns.

**Local Terraform State First**

Infrastructure is initially developed using local state for rapid iteration.  
Remote backend and deployment automation will be introduced later.

**Modular Terraform Design**

Reusable infrastructure logic is implemented in focused Terraform modules, while `infrastructure/envs/dev` stays thin and composition-oriented.

This keeps changes reviewable, reduces refactoring churn, and supports future multi-environment expansion.

**Incremental Module Hardening**

Infrastructure slices may begin as environment-driven compositions while the
required behavior is being proven in real AWS.

Once a layer is validated end to end, its reusable module is tightened,
documented, example-backed, and CI-validated before the next major platform
layer is introduced.

This allows delivery to stay incremental without leaving temporary module
assumptions in place longer than necessary.

---

## Security Principles

- Least-privilege IAM access
- Edge protection using AWS WAF
- Private S3 origin behind CloudFront
- Managed identity via Amazon Cognito
- Failure isolation using SQS dead-letter queues where asynchronous processing is used

---

## Cost Awareness

The system is designed to operate within:

- AWS promotional credits
- Always-free service limits

No EC2 instances, NAT Gateways, or relational databases are used.

---

## Environment Strategy

- Development begins with a single `dev` environment
- Terraform modules allow future multi-environment expansion
- Deployment automation will be added after validating the core platform

---

## Documentation

Detailed architecture description:

- `docs/architecture.md`
- `docs/platform-behavior.md`
- `docs/local-setup.md`
- `infrastructure/envs/dev/README.md`
- each module also contains its own `README.md` in the module root directory

---

## Developer Tooling

The current local backend and infrastructure workflow expects:

- Python
- Docker
- Terraform
- `tflint`
- `terraform-docs`

Frontend tooling is not yet a hard project baseline, but Node.js and npm are
expected to be added once frontend implementation becomes an active track.

See:

- `docs/local-setup.md`

---

## Future Improvements

- Custom domain and TLS configuration
- Monitoring dashboards and alerting
- Automated frontend deployment
- Multi-environment promotion strategy
- Advanced security hardening
